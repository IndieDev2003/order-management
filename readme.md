## 🌟 Key Notes

- This structure is modular and scalable, making it easy to maintain and expand the project.
- Use `services/` if the application grows to manage complex logic outside the controllers.

Feel free to adapt this structure to suit your project's specific needs!



## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Implement role-based access control (e.g., Admin, Manager, Employee).
- Add analytics and reporting for order statistics.
- Integrate payment processing for seamless transactions.
